## Voice project updates (durable)
- Voice app (`/root/.openclaw/workspace/voice-call-agent`) was stabilized and repeatedly restarted during troubleshooting.
- E2E smoke test was aligned to current behavior (4 generated questions, explicit post-wrap-up "no" required before hangup) and passed (`E2E_SMOKE_OK`).
- Commit pushed to `joblynk-aiexploration/Softwise-Technical-Screening` on `main`: `49528d8`.

## Prompt architecture changes
- Added per-agent prompt files and routing:
  - `config/sara_system_prompt.txt`
  - `config/adam_system_prompt.txt`
  - `config/sara_prompt.json`
  - `config/adam_prompt.json`
- Added prompt-driven interview path for Sara/Adam in `app/main.py` (two-way logic + must-ask integration).
- Intro standardized to:
  - "Hi, this is Sara from Joblynk. Is this a good time to talk?"
  - "Hi, this is Adam from Joblynk. Is this a good time to talk?"
- After confirmation, flow now includes: "I am calling regarding the {job_title} position..."

## Call flow fixes applied
- Removed early "didn't catch that" on initial answer webhook to prevent wrong first voice/branch.
- Added handshake gate (`prompt_handshake_done`) so interview only starts after candidate confirms timing.
- Reduced interruption risk by changing gather `speech_timeout` from `auto` to `3`.
- Added loop guards for repeated same-question / repeated generic responses.
- Added final-questions stage (`Do you have any questions before we conclude...`) instead of repeating last technical question.
- Added end-intent handling ("end call", "bye", etc.).

## Handoff behavior
- Candidate questions are handled two-way; if unknown/policy-sensitive, Sara/Adam defer and mark manager handoff requested.
- End-of-call handoff now says:
  - "Please hold for a moment while I connect you to our hiring manager now."
- Added 2-second pause before conference bridge.
- Manager handoff target remains `+17736563444`.

## Observability / UI status improvements
- Logging expanded for both sides:
  - `VOICE_INPUT ...`
  - `VOICE_REPLY ...`
- Right panel session auto-refresh improved:
  - auto status sync (no manual "Check Call Status" dependency)
  - filter sessions by selected `job_id`
- Added stale-call auto-finalizer from 6 min to **2 min** to prevent stuck `in-progress` UI.

## Template intake (customer-facing web)
- New purchased template archive verified at `/home/ubuntu/template.zip` (large NextSaaS pack).
- Extracted and staged selected variant `ai-agency` into:
  - `/root/.openclaw/workspace/apps/customer-frontend`
- This is prepared for customer-facing homepage/external pages migration; production cutover still needs host/service routing details.
