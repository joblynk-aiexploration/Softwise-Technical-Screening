# 2026-02-20

- Voice-call-agent upgraded with enterprise screening capabilities: unified nav/menu behavior, profile persistence in DB, candidate/call/activity persistence, candidates list/detail pages, and timeline views.
- LiveKit integration delivered as isolated module (`livekit_agent/`) with provider modes (`legacy|livekit|auto`) and graceful fallback to legacy.
- GitHub Actions deployment path to LiveKit Cloud was debugged end-to-end; final successful deployment confirmed for agent `CA_Jqv75J34VuwE`.
- Added call-level provider attribution (`provider_used`, `provider_reason`) in `screening_calls` and surfaced provider details in candidate call timeline UI.
- Implemented pre-call agent selection in InstantScreen with two personas: `Sara` and `Adam`, with Sara default selected.
- Added real voice preview flow with caching and browser fallback; added deterministic local TTS cache plus retention cleanup controls (`TTS_CACHE_MAX_FILES`, `TTS_CACHE_MAX_DAYS`) to minimize ElevenLabs credit usage.
- Public website structure added: Home (`/`), Login (`/login`), Contact Us (`/contact-us`) with professional full-page design, menu, AL logo branding, and section imagery.
- Contact form now submits to backend endpoint (`POST /contact-us`) and shows success message.
- User preference established: for this project, proceed proactively on important fixes/improvements without waiting for approval.
- Access preference established: from homepage, only public pages should be visible; internal pages remain login-protected.
